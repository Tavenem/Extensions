Tavenem.Extensions
==

Tavenem.Extensions is a collection of useful extension methods used within the Tavenem family of projects and packages. Although its target audience is primarily internal (other Tavenem libraries), it is freely available to other developers who might find these extensions helpful.

The library currently consists of extensions to the [IEnumerable\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1) and [IDictionary\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.idictionary-2) interfaces. There are a limited number of classes and each method is well-documented, so the best way to see what is currently included is to browse the source.

## Installation

Tavenem.Extensions is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tavenem.Extensions/).

## Roadmap

Tavenem.Extensions is a relatively stable helper library which sees minimal development. Although additions and bugfixes are always possible, no specific updates are planned at this time.
